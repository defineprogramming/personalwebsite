Since the file "leo_website/js/vue.js" is a library file, it should contain the Vue.js library code. However, it's not practical to generate the entire Vue.js library code here. Instead, you would typically download the Vue.js library from the official Vue.js website or include it via a CDN.

For the purpose of this task, I'll provide a link to the Vue.js library via a CDN. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this link with the path to your local "vue.js" file.

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.6.12/dist/vue.js"></script>
```

Please replace the above script tag's src attribute value with the local path to your "vue.js" file in your HTML files.
