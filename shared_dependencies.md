Shared Dependencies:

1. **HTML**: All HTML files (index.html, home.html, about.html, portfolio.html, contact.html) share the same basic structure and dependencies such as the link to the CSS file (tailwind.css) and JavaScript files (vue.js, main.js). They also share common DOM elements like header and footer which are Vue components.

2. **Tailwind CSS**: This CSS file is linked in all HTML files for styling. It provides utility classes that are used across all HTML files.

3. **Vue.js**: This is the Vue library file which is linked in all HTML files. It is necessary for the Vue components (header.vue, footer.vue, card.vue) and the main.js file.

4. **main.js**: This is the main Vue instance file. It imports and uses the Vue components and is linked in all HTML files.

5. **Vue Components**: The header.vue and footer.vue components are used in all HTML files. The card.vue component might be used in multiple places, like the home page and portfolio page, to display different content.

6. **Images**: The profile.jpg image might be used in multiple places like the home page and about page. The portfolio images (portfolio1.jpg, portfolio2.jpg, portfolio3.jpg) are used in the portfolio page.

7. **DOM Element IDs**: IDs like 'app', 'header', 'footer', 'home', 'about', 'portfolio', 'contact' are used in the HTML files and referenced in the JavaScript files.

8. **Data Schemas**: The data schema for Leo's information (name, job, about, portfolio, contact) is shared across multiple files. It might be defined in the main.js file and used in the Vue components and HTML files.

9. **Function Names**: Functions like 'createApp', 'mount', 'createCard' might be defined in the main.js file and used in the Vue components and HTML files.
